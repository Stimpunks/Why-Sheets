# Hoodie

[Student name] will wear a plain hoodie in the future rather than the school blazer. This is because the texture and fit of the blazer are uncomfortable and distract them from engaging comfortably in learning. Likewise, the hood enables them to screen out sensory clutter and facilitates concentration.

> Uniform adjustments: hard collars, ties, leather school shoes, formal skirts and trousers, these can all be difficult to manage for many autistic people. The use of more comfortable fabrics can allow us to concentrate more fully on our tasks. Many schools now encourage children to attend school with trainers and a school hoodie for comfort and practicality.

> The picture shows a school classroom as I see it, as an autistic person. A kaleidoscope of shape and blinding lighting, with vague outlines which are probably other students. Deafening noise. The stench of different smells. The confusion of many voices, including some heard through walls from neighbouring halls and classes. School uniform that feels like barbed wire on my skin.
