# Behaviorism

> Behaviorism is a dehumanizing mechanism of learning that reduces human beings to simple inputs and outputs. There is an [ever-growing body of research](https://www.humanrestorationproject.org/writing/empty-pedagogy-behaviorism-and-the-rejection-of-equity) suggesting that behaviorism is not only harmful to how we learn, but is also oppressive, ableist, and racist.

## Behaviorism measures the surface, badly.

- [Behaviorism is a theory of learning that focuses on observable behaviors and environmental stimuli.](https://www.verywellmind.com/behavioral-psychology-4157183)
- [Behaviorism only looks at observable behavior which can be measured. It doesn’t take into account thoughts, genetics, anxiety, trauma, health, or emotions because those things cannot be measured.](https://neuroclastic.com/2021/04/08/what-is-aba-and-does-it-work/)
- [The more our attention is fixed on the surface, the more we slight students’ underlying motives, values, and needs.](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/behavior/)
- [Behaviors are just the protruding tip of the proverbial iceberg. What matters more than “What?” or “How much?” is “How come?”](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/behavior/)
- [Behaviorists ignore, or actively dismiss, subjective experience – the perceptions, needs, values, and complex motives of the human beings who engage in behaviors.](https://www.alfiekohn.org/blogs/autism/)
- [Behaviourism is a reduction of dimensions which creates an illusion of scientific worth by focussing only on what we can ‘know for sure’.](https://monotropism.org/dinah/dimensions-of-difference/)
- [Ultimately behaviorism provides a simplistic lens that can’t see beyond itself.](https://neuroclastic.com/2020/10/14/behaviorism-is-dead-how-do-we-tell-the-autism-parents/)
- [Why is the doctrine of behaviorism still being used, at all?](https://neuroclastic.com/2020/10/14/behaviorism-is-dead-how-do-we-tell-the-autism-parents/)
- [Behaviorism is a repudiation, an almost willful dismissal, of subjective experience.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MJbqkzDTdg&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fstimpunks.org%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY&feature=emb_logo)
- [It’s time we outgrew this limited and limiting psychological theory. That means attending less to students’ behaviors and more to the students themselves.](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/behavior/)
- [How can ABA be the gold-standard for autism when it ignores everything we know about autism?](https://neuroclastic.com/2020/10/14/behaviorism-is-dead-how-do-we-tell-the-autism-parents/)
- [The focus on surface behavior, without seeming to understand or be concerned about the complexity, or even the simple dichotomy of volitional versus autonomic (stress response) and the use of outdated, compliance based, animal based behaviorism (which has no record of long term benefits) continues to fail our country’s students.](https://endseclusion.org/articles/the-problem-with-behaviorism/)
- [Radical Behaviourism is broadly seen by psychology professionals as a simplistic and restrictive theory which is useful in certain situations but cannot sum up the entirety of the human experience. It doesn’t even satisfactorily answer some questions about behaviours seen in animals.](https://neuroclastic.com/is-aba-really-dog-training-for-children-a-professional-dog-trainer-weighs-in/?__twitter_impression=true&fbclid=IwAR3E6kZQHA7IJtpN279-WEhfM2FegGynTGgiKm-QLFM4DlBeseoh9egos0Q&amp)

- [ABA is a breeding ground for meltdowns. The only way ABA knows how to “train” a child, to “motivate” them (as if they were lacking in motivation before this), is to negate their needs or take away their joy.](https://autisticscienceperson.com/2023/03/31/autism-acceptance-week-and-applied-behavior-analysis/)
- [This is a child’s heart in fight or flight mode, constantly, that is being bombarded with all these instructions and prompting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MJbqkzDTdg&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fstimpunks.org%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY&feature=emb_logo)

- [Compliance, learned helplessness, food/reward-obsessed, magnified vulnerabilities to sexual and physical abuse, low self-esteem, decreased intrinsic motivation, robbed confidence, inhibited interpersonal skills, isolation, anxiety, suppressed autonomy, prompt dependency, adult reliance, etc., continue to be created in a marginalized population who are unable to defend themselves.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311908.2019.1641258)
- [These children are the population that was chosen to be the subjects of an experimentally intense, lifelong treatment within a therapy where most practitioners are ignorant regarding the Autistic brain—categorically, this cannot be called anything except abuse.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311908.2019.1641258)

Parents are relentlessly told that that’s their job.](https://longreads.com/2019/12/17/normal-sucks-author-jonathan-mooney-on-how-schools-fail-kids-with-learning-differences/)

- [Pretty much everything an autistic child does, says, doesn’t do or doesn’t say is pathologised and made into a way to invent a ‘therapy’ for it. It’s actually hell to experience.](https://twitter.com/annmemmott/status/1015968112674574336?s=12)
