# Positive Greetings at the Door

Many neurodivergent people have difficulties with the [eye contact](https://stimpunks.org/eye-contact/), [touching](https://stimpunks.org/access/perceptual-worlds/), [speaking](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/situational-mutism/), and other acts of performative [neuronormativity](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/neuronormativity/)that are expected when entering a classroom that implements Positive Greetings at the Door (PGD).

[Exposure anxiety](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/exposure-anxiety/), threshold anxiety, and [situational mutism](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/situational-mutism/) are widespread in our community. Their intensity is overwhelming. PGD policies turn teachers into anxiety-inducing “threshold guardians” that we have to get past by performing. This is an exhausting and dysregulating start to the day.

Classroom door greetings are steeped in [PBS/PBIS](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/behaviorism/), a form of [behaviorism](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/behaviorism/) overwhelmingly opposed by the neurodiversity movement.

Two studies often cited in favor of PGD are full of behaviorist framing and language.

Cook, Aria Fiat, Madeline Larson, Christopher Daikos, Tal Slemrod, Elizabeth A. Holland, Andrew J. Thayer, Tyler Renshaw, 2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1098300717753831)

[Behaviorist](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/behaviorism/) education is [ableist](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/ableism/) education.
You don’t need to do door greetings. There are better ways to invite people into shared space that don’t induce anxiety at thresholds, those liminal lines between [inclusion](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/inclusion/) and exclusion.

We advise against posting any sort of threshold guardian or threshold ritual. If you must implement PDG, PDG policies can be improved and better avoid ableism by supporting multiple [modalities](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/modality/) and embracing [flexibility](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/flexibility/) as good [UDL](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/universal-design-for-learning/). Allow greetings of all sorts:

- Spoken
- Fist bump
- Handshake
- Thumbs up
- Hug
- Virtual hug
- Head nod
- Sign of the horns

> Nonverbal interpersonal interactions, such as a friendly handshake or a thumbs-up, can help make greetings feel authentic and build trust—as long as students feel comfortable with physical contact.

Also allow no response at all. Compliance is not the goal, a good start to the day is the goal. Forcing students to perform against their mood is a bad start to the day. Forcing students to be false to themselves and their reality is counterproductive.

[Trust](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/trust/) and [authenticity](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/very-grand-emotions/) are important to many autistic people. We’re [wired for it](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/canary/). Forcing us to perform neuronormativity and [toxic positivity](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/toxic-positivity/)destroys trust and authenticity. Such coercion is [gaslighting](https://medium.com/@sheaemmafett/10-things-i-wish-i-d-known-about-gaslighting-22234cb5e407), as it is an attempt to “[overwrite another person’s reality](https://medium.com/@sheaemmafett/10-things-i-wish-i-d-known-about-gaslighting-22234cb5e407)“. Such coercion contributes to [school-induced anxiety](https://stimpunks.org/glossary/school-induced-anxiety/).
